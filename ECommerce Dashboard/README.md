![ECommerce Dashboard](https://github.com/AthiraThulasi/Power-BI/blob/main/ECommerce%20Dashboard/ECommerce_Dashboard_Git.png)


This project involves analyzing sales data from an eCommerce store to derive meaningful insights into customer behavior, product performance, and overall profitability. The dashboard was created using Power BI, with an emphasis on interactive visuals that help stakeholders quickly identify key trends and make data-driven decisions.

### TABLES – Order Table & Details Table

**Order Table – Order ID, Order Date, Customer Name, State, City**

**Details Table – Order ID, Amount, Profit, Quantity, Category, Sub-Category, Payment Mode**

### Key Insights Included in the Dashboard:
1. **Top 5 Customers by Sales**: Identifies the most valuable customers in terms of revenue contribution.
2. **Monthly Profit Trends**: Displays how profit fluctuates from month to month, highlighting the state with the highest profit.
3. **Top 5 Product Subcategories**: Shows the most profitable product subcategories, helping the business focus on high-margin products.
4. **Market Locations**: Pinpoints the top 5 markets where the business generates the highest sales.
5. **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Tracks the average amount spent per order, which is a key metric for understanding customer purchasing behavior.
6. **Gross Margin Analysis**: Highlights the gross margin percentage, helping identify product categories that generate the most direct profit before considering indirect costs.

### Questions Addressed:
1. **Who are our top 5 customers?**
2. **Which are the top 5 most profitable product subcategories?**
3. **Where are our biggest markets located?**
4. **How does profit fluctuate month over month?**
5. **Which state is the most profitable?**

### Explanation of Questions in the Chart
I chose to incorporate questions directly into the chart rather than simply labeling the X and Y variables for several reasons:

**Clarity of Purpose:** Each question clearly defines the focus of the analysis, helping viewers understand the specific insights the chart aims to provide. This approach ensures that the audience knows exactly what information they should glean from the data.

**Engagement:** Posing questions encourages viewers to think critically about the data presented. It invites them to explore the answers actively rather than passively reading labels.

**Contextual Relevance:** The questions provide context to the data, connecting it to real business concerns. By framing the insights in terms of questions, the analysis aligns more closely with strategic objectives, making it easier for stakeholders to relate to the findings.

**Facilitates Discussion:** Presenting questions fosters a more interactive dialogue among team members or stakeholders when reviewing the chart. It opens up opportunities for discussion on the insights, implications, and next steps based on the findings.

**Focus on Actionable Insights:** The questions highlight key areas of interest and focus on actionable insights that can drive decision-making, rather than merely presenting data points without context.

### Learnings / Key Takeaways
In this sales analysis project, I gained valuable experience in data cleaning and manipulation using Power BI. 

**Key activities included:**

**Data Cleaning:** Ensured data accuracy and consistency by identifying and correcting errors, handling missing values, and removing duplicates.

**Data Transformation:** Utilized Power Query to transform raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis, including filtering, aggregating, and reshaping data.

**Data Loading:** Successfully loaded the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI for visualization and analysis.

**Average Order Value (AOV) Calculation:** Added a new column to calculate the Average Order Value, enhancing the insights derived from the sales data.
